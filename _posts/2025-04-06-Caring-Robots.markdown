The project Caring Robots // Robotic Care is a transdisciplinary project on participatory design with care stakeholders in Vienna, Austria.

For one project, I organized [a series of participatory design workshops for care stakeholders](https://doi.org/10.1145/3652037.3652070), specifically care workers and care home residents. I developed and ran this workshop series together with colleagues with expertise in sociology, participatory design and Human-Computer Interaction, and engineering. 

Based on this project, we identified Documentation Support as a potential technology that could meet needs of care workers in this context. We then developed a [prototype for care documentation](https://doi.org/10.34726/6399) from speech using Large Language Models. 

Doing research and developing technologies in the care context requires careful consideration of [ethical aspects](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-84901-5_2), including [privacy](https://doi.org/10.34726/5960).
