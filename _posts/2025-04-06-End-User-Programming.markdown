End-user programming for Human-Robot Interaction means developing tools and methods that enable non-programmers to program robots. I did research on cobot user interfaces that are intended for end-user programming, and developed [design guidelines](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-85613-7_28) for such systems. I also investigated interaction design aspects of tools that make use of motion imitation to program robot motion. For this, I developed a prototype for [recording robot motion](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/ARSO60199.2024.10557907), based on a system for [human-humanoid motion imitation](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/RO-MAN50785.2021.9515480) for the Pepper robot.
