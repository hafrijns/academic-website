I am a postdoctoral researcher focused on interaction design and interface design in Human-Robot Interaction and Human-AI interaction. My current research interests include adaptation and learning of users in interaction with technologies, user mental models in interaction, and interface and interaction design for Human-Robot Collaboration scenarios.
