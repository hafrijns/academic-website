I am a postdoctoral researcher focused on interaction design and interface design in Human-Robot Interaction and Human-AI interaction. My current research interests include adaptation and learning of users in interaction with technologies, user mental models in interaction, and interface and interaction design for Human-Robot Collaboration scenarios. I am currently at the [Intelligent User Interfaces group at IT:U](https://it-u.at/en/research/research-groups/intelligent-user-interfaces/).
