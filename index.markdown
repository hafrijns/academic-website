This is a template for an academic website using Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages. See the [Jekyll Quickstart guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). The site uses the default Minima theme (latest stable, [Minima](https://rubygems.org/gems/minima) 2.5.2,). Feel free to reuse. I added minimal adaptations: sorting of the pages in the navigation bar, a custom scholar icon and some other edits.
